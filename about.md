- PII Tools. We will quite soon look into PII tools where we will add possibilitys to filter possibly sensitiva data out automatically. We will also add tools where administrators easilly can delete data.
- Form Template GUI. A GUI to create forms will probably be needed to enable our users even more.
- Form preview support. Beeing able to preview the form output when you select your template is a nice one.
- Advanced visibility rules. The tagmanager gives us some simple rules, but we will look into more advanced ones like: "Valid for X days" etc.
- Add value based display. Add options to display different questions based on the users previos answers.
