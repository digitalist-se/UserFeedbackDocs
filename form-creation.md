# Form creation
Form creation is where you configure the actual form displayed to the endvisitors.

When you create a form, you will need to first select a form template. 
Based on the form template you will see different fields to configure. 

If your template contains a Stars widget and a free text field you will be promted with title and description inputs for this form in the interface.

Next step is to publish the form via the TagManager in Matomo.
