# Form reporting | Matomo feedback forms
Form collection is stored in separate tables in Matomos Database, but we connect form submissions to Visitors in Matomo. 

## Segment Form Results
By doing so we can apply segments ontop of our Form data which is a really nice feature.

This means that we can create segmented reports like: 
How happy are customer segment 1 compared to customer segment 2.
Since Matomo supports very advanced segmentation the possibilitys here are endless.
You could possibly also create segments based on data coming from other resources such as your CRM or similar, this is quite uniqe for our solution.


## Query Results through Matomos API
Since we display our data with Matomos built in Tables, we automatically get API Support for our data.
This means that you can create automated querys to from your favourite Visualisation tool and get survey data into these reports quite easilly.

## Visualisation
We did not focus on this for release 1, we believe most people will analyze their data outsido of Matomo anyway. This might be something we look into in the future though.
