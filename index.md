## Welcome the documentation for Matomo User Feedback plugin

This page documents use cases and will also be the place where you can create feature requests or send bug reports. 

This plugin is under development and the planned release will be in December 2020.

# Overall concept
The plugin is used to manage website feedback forms, like surveys and questionares on your web sites.
The unique thing with this plugin is that we build it tightly integrated with Matomo.

## This means:
- Tight integration with Matomos Tag Manager for deployment of your Feedback Forms
- Report data is integrated with the Matomo data. This means that you can filter your report data just like any other data in Matomo by using date ocr segments.
- You can also rely on Matomos API to export the feedback data to any other system
